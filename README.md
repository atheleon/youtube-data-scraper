Welcome to the YouTube Scraper 3000! This gloriously fragile script is your ticket to scraping basic information from a YouTube channel—until YouTube inevitably changes its layout, leaving this program utterly useless. With channel_url, you can input the full channel URL (in the new, obnoxious “@username” format) so the script can scrape, dig, and pry its way to some video data. Variables like max_videos let you limit the number of videos scraped because let’s be honest—you probably don’t want to trust this thing too much. It extracts views, likes, upload_date, duration, tags, and even subscriber_count, assuming YouTube hasn’t hidden them behind some JavaScript fortress yet. The crown jewel of this script, get_video_details(), attempts to dive into each video page to fish out metadata, but be warned: it’s as delicate as a house of cards. It uses parse_relative_date() to convert vague upload dates like "2 months ago" into real dates, but hey, good luck if that ever changes. This masterpiece may become deprecated, broken, or entirely useless at the slightest whisper of a YouTube update, so enjoy it while it lasts!
